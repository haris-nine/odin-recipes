    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This liver and onions recipe will turn liver haters into converts! It's very simple to make but the three things that will set your liver above all others are: 1) soak in milk, 2) turn the liver as little as possible when cooking, and 3) don't overcook.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds sliced beef liver</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 large Vidalia onions, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently rinse liver slices under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Place in a shallow dish; pour in enough milk to cover. Let stand while preparing onions, or set aside for longer if you have time. Soaking will remove any bitterness.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion rings; cook and stir in butter until tender and soft, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer onions into a bowl and set the skillet aside.</li>
        <li>Place flour on a plate; season with salt and pepper. Drain milk from liver and coat liver slices in flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet; increase heat to medium-high and fry coated liver slices until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Return onions to the skillet and reduce heat to medium; continue to cook until onions are heated through and liver is slightly pink inside, or longer to suit your taste.</li>
    </ol>
